# Insight Consulting Project
Contains selected code for Insight consulting project, summer 2019

For my Insight Health Data Science project, I consulted for a precision medicine company that helps physicians match their patients to appropriate clinical trials.  My goal was to find features in medical records that are related to disease progression and to identify important subgroups of patients.  Most of my code for this project will only be shared with my client.

As part of my data analysis pipeline, I used a random forest classifier to evaluate how well I could predict disease progression based on different combinations of features.
